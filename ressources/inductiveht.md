*Incantamentum est magicum vinculum, quo necessitate alicuia forma creatur, intelligitur, mutatur, perditur aut regitur secundum leges quas hermeticas appellabo.*

A spell is a magical bond by the necessity of which a certain form is created, understood, transformed, destroyed or controlled according to the laws which I shall call hermetic.

— Bonisagus*(Note : It is alleged by some hermetic scholars that Bonisagus may have been influenced by the definition of a legal obligation given in the *Institutiones* of Roman Emperor Justinian : "*obligatio est iuris vinculum, quo necessitate adstringimur alicuius solvendae rei, secundum nostrae civitatis iura*" (3, 13, *pr.*). Further studies will have to ascertain whether other similarities may be found between Roman law and Hermetic Theory.)*

# Introduction  
Ars Magica has one of the richest, if not *the* richest system of magic used in any role-playing game. The rules of magic are elaborate, flexible and elegant enough to satisfy the needs of most Storyguide and players under ordinary circumstances.

However, like any system of rules, the one described in Ars Magica rulebook sometimes needs to be interpreted in order to resolve borderline issues or to allow the further development of the game. 

I have defended elsewhere the idea  that the methods of legal reasoning could usefully be followed to interpret and better understand Ars Magica rules (see my reflections on this topic [in French](./jdrdroit.md)). I now wish to use this method in an attempt at what I would like to call the elaboration of an “inductive Hermetic Theory”.

The origin of this attempt is quite simple. Ars Magica rulebook already describes the main principles of Hermetic Magic in chapter 7 with a wealth of details, and these general principles are supplemented in chapter 9 by some more rules pertaining to spell design and guidelines specific to each Art. However, when one starts to browse through the multiple exemplary spells reported in the rest of this chapter, one quickly comes to the conclusion that *other* general rules, either expressed or implied, were used in the design of these spells. For instance, one may discover new kinds of Duration (like in *Wind at the Back* ReAu 5 where “until you stop traveling for more than ten minutes” is equated with Sun Duration) or some precisions about the types of Arcane Connections (see *Image of the Beast* InAn 5 where it is explained that “Wounds caused by an animal are an Arcane Connection to that animal with a lifetime of a few hours”).

Of course, the reader may decide to ignore these hints at a “more general truth” and decide e.g. that a wound caused by animal only creates an Arcane Connection *within the context* of the spell *Image of the Beast*, and that this would not be true in other cases. But what if it were? What if, for instance, a Magus wounded by an animal wanted to destroy it with a Perdo spell? Should the wound then be treated as an Arcane Connection to the animal? And what if the idea was broadened, and that the Magus wounded by a masked assassin wanted to follow the track of him? Could he cast an Intellego Corpus spell and use the wound as an Arcane Connection to the person hired to kill him?

In the following lines, I assume that this kind of precisions given in the description of individual spells are not fortuitous or meaningless, but that they can be seen as the expression of general principles which the interpretation of individual spells may help to reveal and apply in other circumstances. This method can be called “inductive”, because it starts from multiple, concrete spells and tries to build from them a more general and abstract theory.

This method of reasoning would be called, in legal reasoning, a *systematic interpretation**(Note : Comp. the model of interpretation “law as integrity” advocated by the famous legal theoretician [R. Dworkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Dworkin), *Law’s Empire*, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 1998, ch. 6 ff.)*. Arguably, it would not have seemed strange, or even inappropriate to Hermetic Magi, quite the contrary. Indeed, since “*scientific knowledge involves the recognition of the commensurate universal*” (Aristotle, *[Posterior Analytics](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8poa/book1.html)*, 1, 31, 87b), it is perfectly understandable that Hermetic Magi would try to study ordinary or common spells to try to find in them some elements that they could re-use in other spells of their own design. Besides, this method of interpretation can also be traced back to the methods of the [glossators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossator), widely popular among the scholars of the thirteenth century.

The Hermetic Theory I am trying to build is divided in two parts*(Note : This division is inspired by an apocryphal manuscript in German language available in Durenmar’s library and rumoured by some to be of the hand of Bonisagus himself. This manuscript is made of two parts called respectively *Allgemeiner Theil* and *Besonderer Theil der Zauberkräftigen Kunst*.)*. The “general” part describes principles applicable to all spells indistinctly, while the “special” part relates to specific Arts. For each new “rule” or principle, I mention between brackets the spells from which it is inspired. I have tried not to repeat any principle already explained in the rulebook. No other book than the rulebook of the 5th edition has been analysed.

I hope you will find the results of this quick survey interesting or even inspiring*(Note : Who knows, inconsistencies pointed out in this article could possibly be taken into account *de lege ferenda* and corrected in a later edition of Ars Magica ?)*. Do not hesitate to post a comment to share your thoughts about it!

## Complex effects  
### Cosmetic effects  
* Cosmetic effects such as **wind or sound**, or giving the impression that the effect originates from the Magus, do not increase the magnitude of the spell (*Whispers Though the Black Gate* InCo(Me) 15; *Mist of Change* MuCo(An) 60; *The Incantation of the Lightning* CrAu 35, gives the impression that the lightning comes of the hand of the Magus [implicit principle]; *Ball of Abysmal Flame* CrIg 35; *Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie* InMe 20; *Scent of Peaceful Slumber* ReMe 25, smell of lilacs [implicit principle]).  
* One classical cosmetic effect **allows other persons to perceive the result of an Intellego spell** (*Whispers Though the Black Gate* InCo(Me) 15, no cost to allow all those around you to hear the voice of the corpse; *Frosty Breath of the Spoken Lie* InMe 20, no cost for the mist exhaled by the lying Target; see however *Converse with Plant and Tree* InHe 25, “Bystanders cannot understand your conversation”).

### Flexible or multiple effects  
* Allowing the Magus to **slightly adapt the effects** of the spell on the moment that it is cast usually increases the magnitude of the spell by one (*Bridge of Frosts* ReAq 30, +1 to allow various shape). For elaborate design, the level of the spell may increase by as much as three magnitudes (*Teeth of the Earth Mother* MuTe 35, allows to choose the position of the pillars, +2 magnitudes; *Conjuring the Mystical Tower* CrTe 35, allows to choose the design of the interior of the tower, +3 magnitudes).  
* Making spell able to produce **two different kind of effects** usually increases the magnitude of the spell by one (*Hunter’s Sense* InAn 30, +1 for sensing both the shape and primary motivation of the animal; *Ice of Drowning* ReAq 35, +1 for both changing the water to ice and making the chunks of ice pound against anything on the water’s surface; *Preternatural Growth and Shrinking* MuCo 15, +1 because the spell allows growth or two kinds of shrinking; see however *Lifting the Dangling Puppet* ReCo 15 where the Target can be made to rise or descend at no cost, *Supple Iron and Rigid Iron* MuTe 10 which may indifferently make a flexible object stiff or a stiff object flexible at no cost, *Obliteration of the Metallic Barrier* and *Stone to Falling Dust*, both PeTe20, which affect metal and stone at no cost and *Circle of Encompassing Flame* Cr(Re)Ig 35 where the caster may shrink or grow the circle of fire with a Rego requisite but no increase of the level of the spell).  
* A classical additional effect obtained with a Rego requisite is to protect the caster from the spell; this increases the magnitude of the spell by one (*Talons of the Wind* Mu(Re)Aq 20).

### Substantial Requirement  
* A **substantial condition** imposed upon the caster while the intended Base effect could normally have dispensed the Magus of meeting this condition decreases the magnitude of the spell by one (*The Severed Limb Made Whole* CrCo 25, -1 since the old limb is needed; see however *Shape of the Woodland Prowler* MuCo(An) 25, *Cloak of Black Feathers* MuCo(An) 30, *Stance of the Patient Tree* MuCo(He) 35, *Cloak of Mist* MuCo(Au) 40 and *Transform to Water* MuCo(Aq) 40 where the need of a wolf skin, of a cape of raven, of a tree branch, to swallow mist or to pour water in your hand do not decrease the magnitude of the spell, while *Curse of Circe* MuCo(An) 30 and *The Silent Vigil* MuCo(Te) 45 use the Base effect and do not require any pig attribute or piece of rock to be cast).  
### Words & Gestures  
* A spell may be cast **entirely silently** with no penalty by increasing its magnitude by two (*The Kiss of Death* PeCo 45). If one seeks to broaden this principle, one could assume that a spell could be cast with a quiet voice with no penalty or silently with only a -5 penalty by increasing its magnitude by one and that it could be cast with no gestures with no penalty by increasing its magnitude by one (*Black Whisper* PeMe 40).

## Duration of spells  
* When a spell with a Momentary Duration grants a one-use benefit to the Target, the use of this benefit may be **delayed** by no more than ten seconds (*Gift of the Frog’s Legs* ReCo 15).  
* Even after it is expired, a spell may still have some **lasting effects** (*Incantation of the Putrid Wine* MuAq 15 Duration Sun : the room where this spell is cast may not lose the stench for weeks or months; *Wreaths of Foul Smoke* CrAu 10 Duration Diameter : a faint stench of sulfur clings for days to anything exposed to the smoke; *Infernal Smoke of Death* MuAu 40 Duration Concentration : even after you stop concentrating, the corrosive smoke remains deadly and dissipate only after several hours; *Memory of the Distant Dream* CrMe 20 Duration Sun : when the duration expires, the memory vanishes, although the subject may remember remembering it).  
* Special Duration “**until you stop traveling** for more than ten minutes” is equivalent to Sun Duration (*Wind at the Back* ReAu 5).  
## Range of spells  
### Arcane Connection  
* A **wound** inflicted by a Target is and remains an Arcane Connection to this Target for a few hours (*Image of the Beast* InAn 5).  
### Personal  
* If a spell aims at **protecting the Magus from something**, the Target may either be each instance of the thing to be protected from with appropriate Range, most probably Voice (*Repel the Wooden Shafts* ReHe 10), *or* the Magus itself with Personal Range (*Break the Oncoming Wave* ReAq 10).  
### Touch  
* If a spell with a Touch Range has a Duration longer than Momentary, it may affect **any Target which comes in contact** with the caster even after that the spell is cast (*Lungs of the Fish* MuAq(Au) 20; *Trackless Step* ReTe 10). This sometimes increases the magnitude of the spell by one (*Treading the Ashen Path* PeHe 30).  
* Touch Range may affect a **mobile item** so that the origin of the effects moves with the mobile item (*Lamp Without Flame* CrIg 10).  
* If a spell aims at **protecting someone from something**, the Target may either be each instance of the thing to be protected from with appropriate Range, most probably Voice (*Repel the Wooden Shafts* ReHe 10), *or* the person to be protected with Touch Range (*Cloak of the Duck’s Feather* ReAq 5).  
## Target of spells  
### Group  
* Group Target can be used in connection with Touch Range to switch properties between two different Targets (*Exchange of the Two Minds* ReMe 55). Alternatively, if the Magus is one of the two Targets, the spell can be cast with Individual Target (*The Gift of Vigor* ReCo 20).

### Magical senses  
* Magical sense of **Hearing** gives information to the Magus about any phenomenon that the Magus can hear or *could* hear if it were making a noise (*Hunter’s Sense* InAn 30; *Eyes of the Bat* InAu 25).  
### Part  
* Many **inconsistencies** cast doubt on the question when Part Target should be used, e.g. *Twist of the Tongue* PeCo 30 uses Part Target but *Incantation of the Milky Eyes* PeCo 30 does not; see also all ReAq spells which use Individual, Part or Group Target without any apparent reason.  
### Room  
* Room Target may be used **from outside of a Room** with Touch Range simply by touching one of its walls (*Prying Eyes* InIm 5).  
### Wards  
* “*Rego spells can create wards which protect the target from things of the appropriate Form. These use the normal targets, but **the target is the thing protected**, rather than the things warded against, and the range is the range to the target, not to the things warded against*” (ArM5, p. 114). Note that the same reasoning may apply when the Magus wants to use the guidelines pertaining to the control of a thing (usually lower than guidelines for warding against the same thing) but does not need to ward itself against all damages done by this thing (*Cloak of the Duck’s Feather* ReAq 5, with Base 1 “Control a liquid in an extremely gentle way” instead of Base 5 “Ward against mundane water”*(Note : Compare with *Break the Oncoming Wave* ReAq 10.)*; *Ward Against Heat and Flames* ReIg 25, with Base 4 “Control a fire in a slightly unnatural fashion" and +2 magnitude to grant the Target a +15 bonus at Soaking).

</div>
## Creo  
* An animal created with Creo magic is **not disturbed by the Gift** (*The Wizard’s Mount* CrAn 35).  
## Intellego  
* When used with an Arcane Connection Range, Intellego Magic allows you to perceive not only the Target but also the **surroundings of the Target** provided they are connected with the Form used (*Eyes of the Flame* InIg 35 allows to see a fire as well as anything which the fire illuminates). To get a better view of the surroundings of the Target, an Imaginem requisite is required (*The Eye of the Sage* InCo(Im) 30, allows to see within one pace of the Target).

## Muto  
* **Increasing the Size** of a Target by +1 also increases its Strength by +2 and the range for each wound level by one and decreases its Quickness by -1 (*Beast of Outlandish Size* MuAn 15; *Beast of Minuscule Proportion* MuAn 20).  
* An animal changed in a major unnatural way with Muto magic is **not disturbed by the Gift** (*Steed of Vengeance* MuAn 35).  
* A Muto spell which changes the Target into something else and also **allows it to return to its previous form at will** does not cost any additional magnitude but the spell ends when the Target decides to recover its previous shape even if the Duration of the spell is not expired (*Shape of the Woodland Prowler* MuCo(An) 25; *Cloak of Black Feathers* MuCo(An) 30; *Stance of the Patient Tree* MuCo(He) 35; *Cloak of Mist* MuCo(Au) 40; *Transform to Water* MuCo(Aq) 40).  
## Rego  
* A Rego requisite may ensure that an effect produced with another Technique **only affects the Target** chosen by the Magus and nothing else. This usually increases the magnitude of the spell by one (*Curse of the Ravenous Swarm* Cr(Re)An 45*(Note : In the calculation of the level of the spell, the rulebook wrongly assumes that a Group Target increases the magnitude of the spell by one instead of two. If this error is corrected, the level of the spell should then be 50.)*; *Coat of Flame* Cr(Re)Ig 25; *The Crystal Dart* Mu(Re)Te 10; see however *Palm of Flame* CrIg 5 with no Rego requisite and *Conjuration of the Indubitable Cold* Pe(Re)Ig 25 where the Rego requisite does not increase the magnitude of the spell).  
## Auram  
* Auram spells without any Ignem requisite **do not affect temperature** even if they cause snow to fall (*Clouds of the Summer Snow* CrAu 25).  
## Imaginem  
* Affecting **light or shadow** with an Imaginem spell requires an Ignem requisite and increases the magnitude of the spell by one (*Phantasmal Fire* CrIm(Ig) 20; *Chamber of Invisibility* PeIm 25, affected Targets still cast shadows).  
* By adding an Intellego requisite and increasing the level of the spell by one magnitude, an Imaginem spell allows the Magus **to see and hear** what happens where the illusion is located (*Haunt of the Living Ghost* Cr(In)Im 35; *Image of the Wizard Torn* Re(In)Im 30).  
*  Imaginem spells affects **the ability of an object or a person to be perceived by others**. The Target of those spell is therefore the object or the person itself, not the sounds, sight, etc. of this object/person (*Invisibility of the Standing Wizard* PeIm 15; *Veil of Invisibility* PeIm 20; *Removal of the Conspicuous Sigil* PeIm 20; *Silence of the Smothered Sound* PeIm 20; *Chamber of Invisibility* PeIm 25; *The Captive Voice* ReIm 25).  
## Mentem  
* **Translation of foreign language** can be achieved with an Intellego Mentem spell of Base 5 and the person speaking the foreign language as Target. The most basic spell would then  be of level 15 (Base 5, Range Touch +1, Duration Concentration +1, Target Individual) (*Thoughts Within Babble* InMe 25 [implicit principle]).
